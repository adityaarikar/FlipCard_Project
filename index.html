                    <hr />
                    <p>Shiva is one of the three main gods in Hinduism. Shiva is causeless auspiciousness. An embodiment
                        of ultimate space of enlightenment. He assumed human form to guide humans in the past and thus
                        is known as Adhiguru (first guru).
                        His space of enlightenment is what all spiritual seekers aspire for. All enlightened masters
                        live in this space of Shiva. Shiva is known as the destroyer god because he removes all evil
                        from the world. His wife is the goddess Parvati.</p>

                    <hr />
                    <p>Over the course of his life, Shivaji engaged in both alliances and hostilities with the Mughal Empire, Sultanate of Golkonda and Sultanate of Bijapur, as well as European colonial powers. Shivaji's military forces expanded the Maratha sphere of influence, capturing and building forts, and forming a Maratha navy. Shivaji established a competent and progressive civil rule with well-structured administrative organisations. He revived ancient Hindu political traditions and court conventions and promoted the usage of Marathi and Sanskrit, rather than the Persian language, in court and administration.</p>
